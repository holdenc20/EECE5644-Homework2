For the Theoretically optimal classifier, we have the following results:
Min p(error) = 0.2579
Discriminant = 1.337
This would be an accuracy of 74.21%
 - our quadractic results were about this which makes sense


Linear classifier
Training with 20
Min p(error) = 0.4262
Training with 200
Min p(error) = 0.3887
Training with 2000
Min p(error) = 0.4

Quadractic classifier
Training with 20
Min p(error) = 0.3495
Training with 200
Min p(error) = 0.2644
Training with 2000
Min p(error) = 0.26

in report:

mention the 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5 for the Theoretical gamma
how we get the Theoretical classifier g1 / g0
